                            <span class="page__left_underline">Diana Penelope Burnwood</span> is one of the "handlers" at the International Contract Agency (also known as the Agency, or ICA), providing Agent 47 with clients, targets, and information. She has, since Hitman's inception, been a prominent part of every story and proved a valuable asset to Agent 47 for the most part.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            She is the deuteragonist of the <b class="page__left_bold">HITMAN</b> series, while in <b class="page__left_bold">HITMAN III</b>, she served as a major antagonist, but turned to the deuteragonist later on.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            She has a composed British accent and a business-like demeanor. For the vast majority of the series, Agent 47 never sees Diana or her face, recognizing her only by voice. She is not supposed to meet 47 in person, nor develop a personal friendship with him, but does so anyway (meeting him in person after his near-death experience and again just before his funeral to use the "fake-death serum" to maintain her cover as Alexander Leland Cayne's nurse, to dodge death herself).

He is a professional hitman and former top agent for the International Contract Agency, until he exposed agency information to the public, ending them permanently.

                            Janus was the KGB's legendary cold war spy master and the first Constant of Providence.
                            Janus' true origins is a mystery (mainly because he had the records carefully erased). Some say he was born in Belarus, the son of humble farmers, while others insist that he is of communist royalty; the bastard son of Nikita Khrushchev. The variety of myths surrounding him only add to his legend.
